## 1. An OpenCL wrapper
Have been working on `OpenCL` these days. Since the complexity of those "environment objects", I think it necessary to write a wrapper to include all necessary components when performing computation. 
My purpose is to write one matrix-matrix multiplication instance. The question is that if I put all `OpenCL` configurations in the matrix class, all instances of this matrix class will need to hold one copy of this class. So I think it appropriate to declare this config subclass `static`. 
But this is not the end, since if I declare one non-built-in class within one class, this `static` type should be defined outside of the class.
