I've been reading LLVM material for a whole day. It's a really exicting work by Chris Lattner(He build the project during his graduate study, how amazing!)
### 1. Intro
LLVM is a **compiler**. Different from other compilers, LLVM can achieve cross-platform compilation. LLVM has intermediate representation(IR) which is a great innovation and make the project independent from platform. Since it has backend to translate IR to target machine without human interference. This [page](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/llvm.html) provides an introductory material for LLVM users.

In compiler classes, we know compiler can be divided into front end and back end. The front end for compiler is **Clang**, and back-end is simply LLVM it self which helps to translate IR into different assembly languages on various machine. Here our focus is on **pass**. Passes translate IR to IR and help to optimize code generation. 
These intermediate representtaion is more **regular** structurally. It's easier for us to analyze these assembly language compared to x86. 

To install LLVM, simply follow these 12 steps:
```
1. svn co https://user@llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_500/final llvm
2. cd llvm/tools
3. svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE_500/final clang
4. cd clang/tools # (To be clear, you are now in llvm/tools/clang/tools)
5. svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/clang-tools-extra/tags/RELEASE_500/final extra
6. cd ../../../../llvm/projects # (To be clear, you are now in llvm/projects)
7. svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/tags/RELEASE_500/final compiler-rt
8. cd ../../.. (You are now in your desktop directory)
9. mkdir build (if you have not already done so)
10. cd build (You are now in your build directory)
11. cmake -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" -DLLVM_TARGET_ARCH=X86
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=1
-DCLANG_BUILD_EXAMPLES=1 -G "Unix Makefiles" ../source/llvm/
12. 'make -j 8' (from within the build directory to start the process)
```
The material is copied from a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKIv_Bkp4pk) given by Mike Shah. 

### 2. Try Function Pass
I simply follow the steps descirbed by [page](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/llvm.html). 
`$ git clone https://github.com/sampsyo/llvm-pass-skeleton.git`
and 
```
$ cd llvm-pass-skeleton
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..  # Generate the Makefile.
$ make  # Actually build the pass.
```
`clang -Xclang -load -Xclang build/skeleton/libSkeletonPass.so test.cpp`
This code cannot work on my machine. And I add one flag:
`clang -Xclang -load -Xclang build/skeleton/libSkeletonPass.so -lstdc++ test.cpp`
It works!

A **Module** represents a source file (roughly) or a translation unit (pedantically). Everything else is contained in a Module.

Most notably, Modules house **Functions**, which are exactly what they sound like: named chunks of executable code. (In C++, both functions and methods correspond to LLVM Functions.)

Aside from declaring its name and arguments, a Function is mainly a container of **BasicBlocks**. The basic block is a familiar concept from compilers, but for our purposes, itâ€™s just a contiguous chunk of instructions.

An **Instruction**, in turn, is a single code operation. The level of abstraction is roughly the same as in RISC-like machine code: an instruction might be an integer addition, a floating-point divide, or a store to memory, for example.
**Module, Functions, Block and Instruction** are C++ classes inherit from a base class **Value**. 

If you want to see LLVM IR, you can use `clang -emit -llvm -S -o -test.c`. 
```
namespace {
	struct SkeletonPass : public FunctionPass {
		static char ID;
		SkeletonPass() : FunctionPass(ID) {}

		virtual bool runOnFunction(Functon &F) {
			errs() << "In a function called " << F.getName() << "!\n";
			errs() << "Function body:\n";
			F.print(llvmLerrs());
			for (auto &B : F) {
				errs() << "Basic block:\n";
				B.print(llvm::errs(), true);

				for (auto &I : B) {
					errs() << "Instruction: ";
					I.print(llvm::errs(), true);
				}
			}
			return false;
		}
	};
}
char SkeletonPass::ID = 0;
static void registerSkeletonPass(const PassManagerBuilder&, legacy::PassManagerBase &PM) {
	PM.add(new SkeletonPass());
}
static RegisterStandardPasses RegisterMyPass(PassManagerBuilder::EP_EarlyAsPossible, registerSkeletonPass);
```

### 3. Link with a Run-time library
You can write your run-time behavior in C and link it with the program you've compiled. And LLVM can help you link them together. 
```
// Get the function to call from our runtime library.
LLVMContext& Ctx = F.getContext();
Constant* logFunc = F.getParent()->getOrInsertFunction(
  "logop", Type::getVoidTy(Ctx), Type::getInt32Ty(Ctx), NULL
);

for (auto& B : F) {
  for (auto& I : B) {
    if (auto* op = dyn_cast<BinaryOperator>(&I)) {
      // Insert *after* `op`.
      IRBuilder<> builder(op);
      builder.SetInsertPoint(&B, ++builder.GetInsertPoint());

      // Insert a call to our function.
      Value* args[] = {op};
      builder.CreateCall(logFunc, args);

      return true;
    }
  }
}
```
The tool you need are `Module::getOrInsertFunction` and `IRBuilder::CreateCall`. The former adds a declaration for your runtime function `logop`.
```
#include <stdio.h>
void logop(int i) {
  printf("computed: %i\n", i);
}
```
```
$ cc -c rtlib.c
$ clang -Xclang -load -Xclang build/skeleton/libSkeletonPass.so -c example.c
$ cc example.o rtlib.o
$ ./a.out
12
computed: 14
14
```
