In openCL, an event is a data structure that corresponds too an occurence. One event migh monitor the completion of a data transfer operation and another might monitor the execution of a kernel. 
- host notification
- command synchronization
- profiling

## 1. Host Notification
After the host enqueues a command, it has no controal over how the command will be processed, but it can receive notification when the command completes its execution. --> `cl_event`
For example, when the data transfer is complete, you may want the host application to respond by processing the data. 
You need to assocaite the event with the data transfer command. Then you need to associate the event with a function to be called on the host when the transfer command finishes. -->`callback function`
```
cl_event ev;
clEnqueueTask(queue, kernel, 0, NULL, &ev);
```
