In openCL, an event is a data structure that corresponds too an occurence. One event migh monitor the completion of a data transfer operation and another might monitor the execution of a kernel. 
- host notification
- command synchronization
- profiling

## 1. Host Notification
After the host enqueues a command, it has no controal over how the command will be processed, but it can receive notification when the command completes its execution. --> `cl_event`
For example, when the data transfer is complete, you may want the host application to respond by processing the data. 
You need to assocaite the event with the data transfer command. Then you need to associate the event with a function to be called on the host when the transfer command finishes. -->`callback function`
```
cl_event ev;
clEnqueueTask(queue, kernel, 0, NULL, &ev);
cl_int clSetEventCallback(cl_event event, cl_int callback_type, void (CL_CALLBACK *func_name) (cl_event, cl_int status, void *data), void* data);
```
The second arg `callback_type` identifies the type of command status you're interested in monitoring. `CL_COMPLETE`. 
```
clsetEventCallback(ev, CL_COMPLETE, &process, NULL);
void CL_CALLBACK func_name(cl_event event, cl_int status, void* data);
```
It's important to remember that `clSetEventCallback` must be called **after** the command enqueueing functions, else you will receive a segmentation fault. 
```
/* Enqueue kernel */
err = clEnqueueTask(queue, kernel, 0, NULL, &kernel_event);
if(err < 0) {
  perror("Couldn't enqueue the kernel");
  exit(1);   
}

/* Read the buffer */
err = clEnqueueReadBuffer(queue, data_buffer, CL_FALSE, 0, 
  sizeof(data), &data, 0, NULL, &read_event);
if(err < 0) {
  perror("Couldn't read the buffer");
  exit(1);   
}

/* Set event handling routines */
kernel_msg = "The kernel finished successfully.\n\0";
err = clSetEventCallback(kernel_event, CL_COMPLETE, 
     &kernel_complete, kernel_msg);
if(err < 0) {
  perror("Couldn't set callback for event");
  exit(1);   
}
clSetEventCallback(read_event, CL_COMPLETE, &read_complete, data);
```
