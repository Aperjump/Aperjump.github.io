## 1. Operator
The relational operators tests all components of a vector and the components of the resulting vector identify whether the corresponding test returned true or false. 
For vector components, truth is represented by all 1s (`0xFF, 0xFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF`), openCL represents signed integers using their two's componnets . So the signed value for true is `-1` not `1`. 
If `x` is a vector, you cannot use `if (x > 0)`, this will generate compile time error. 
However, you can test individual components:
`if (x.s0 > 2 && x.s1 > 2)`, or use `any` or `all` function:
`while(all(x > 2))`

## 2. Work-itrem and Work-group
### 2.1 Dimensions and work-items
A work-item is a single implementation of a kernel, and each work-item has an identifier that distinguishes it from every other work-itm that processes the kernel. This identifier, called the global ID, is an array of unsigned integers. 
```
uint get_work_dim();
size_t get_global_size(unit dim);
size_t get_global_id(uint dim);
size_t get_global_offset(uint dim);
```
### 2.2 Work-groups
Work-group become important when work-items need to synchronize their execution. 
```
size_t get_num_groups(uint dim);
size_t get_group_id(uint dim);
size_t get_local_id(uint dim);
size_t get_local_size(uint dim);
```

## 3. Data Transfer
### 3.1 Transfer same type
```
__kernel void test (__global int4 *int_data, __global int4* out_data) {
    __local int4 local_data;
    int id = get_local_id(0);
    local_data = in_data[id];
    ...
    out_data[id] = local_data;
}
```
### 3.2 Load vector from scalar array
```
vector vloadn(size_t offset, const __(g|c|l|p) scalar* mem)
```
`n` identifies the number of components in the returned vector. 
```
void vstoren(vector vec, size_t offset, __(g|l|p) scalar* mem)
```
Just as `vloadn` transfer data from a scalar array to a vector, `vstoren` transfer data from a vector to a scalar array.
